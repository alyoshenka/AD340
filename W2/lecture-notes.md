# Week 2

Gradle = build system for Java ecosystem (primary)

Activity -> main container for a screen (that you would see on a phone); Controller (in MVC)

Adroid UI -> mostly `.xml` files

this^ is the classic approach, there is a new one

`MainActivity.java` <-> `activity_main.xml`

`match_parent` -> same as parent

`wrap_content` -> view size = content size; container gets resized to fit content

Android Philosophy
> Separate design from code and have a declarative UI language

> Text and layout are in different places

"spring" constraint -> can be flexed (not fixed)
