# Week 1

GPA = % * 100 / 4

Java examples, but Kotlin is the standard

Attendance not required

Mostly native development, but touch on hybrid (different ecosystem)

Hybrid -> small companies and startups

Don't need a fancy workflow or multiple repositories

## How Mobile Design is Different
- touch interaction
- network limitations
- diverse screen sizes
- hardware limitations
- user attention
- security and privacy
- distribution and updates

Options for Beta testing are available

## Types of Mobile Applications
- mobile web
- hybrid mobile: web technology deployed in a native 'wrapper'
- cross-platform mobile
- **native**

*Careful about using non-standard tools*
